Slack team conversations getting a little dull? Spice it up by adding Obama Trump to your #general channel. This should be fun.

##Setup
To use Obama Trump with your Slack, visit [your Slack's Integrations page](http://my.slack.com/services/new/bot) and add a new bot called donald_trump. You can also add a profile picture, and we recommend [this one](http://www.liberationnews.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/donaldtrump61815.jpg), but that doesn't really matter. The important bit here is to grab the OAuth token for your bot and save this for later. 

Next, clone this project or [download it as a ZIP](https://github.com/kushaltirumala/trump-slackbot/archive/master.zip) and open up `app.js`. Change `SLACK_TOKEN` to the token of your bot (you can put this in a separate config.js file if you wish to contribute to this repo).

Finally, run `npm install` and `npm start` in the project and you've added Trump!
